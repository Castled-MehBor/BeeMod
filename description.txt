Customizable Bee Colors provides various config menus that allow you to be able to change various parts of bee related textures, to either apply your own color of preference or a rainbow color if you're feeling all over the place.

In order to properly use this mod, make sure that you enable the texture types that you want to modify in 'Modifiable Texture Types', then, when you're ingame, type in the command /beecolor in the chat to toggle on and off the effect.

Whenever you change something in any of the two categories available, it will reset all of the textures; you can simply type /beecolor to enable the effect again.

This is a client side mod, meaning:
- If you're the host of a server and you have this enabled, no one else needs to have it enabled in order to join.
- If you're joining someone and you have this mod enabled, but they don't, it will still remain enabled for you.
- The modified textures will only affect your screen, and no one elses.

It's a very niche mod, I know, but sometimes it would be nice to have just a bit of customization in some commonly experienced pre-hardmode content.

Update v0.2:
- Added the capability to change bee bases (or the yellow parts)
- Separated the config menus into three categories; one for bee stripes, one for bee bases (yellow part) and one for which textures can be modified
- Changing which textures can be modified in 'Modifiable Texture Types' will no longer require a reload
